Seminar presented on
“Machine Learning for SQL Injection Prevention on Server-Side Scripting”
Submitted by
AJAYKUMAR MAJUKAR



SQL injection is the most common web application vulnerability. The vulnerability can
be generated unintentionally by software developer during the development phase. To ensure
that all secure coding practices are adopted to prevent the vulnerability. The framework of SQL
injection prevention using compiler platform and machine learning is proposed. The machine
learning part will be described primarily since it is the core of this framework to support SQL
injection prediction by conducting 1,100 datasets of vulnerabilities to train machine learning
model. The results indicated that decision tree is the best model in term of processing time,
highest efficiency in prediction.
